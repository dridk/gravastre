# Gravastre
C++/Qt rewriting of [Gravastre-2.0](https://github.com/Aluriak/Gravastre-2.0).


## Main idea
Gravastre is a gravitationnal simulation where all agents (named Astres) interacts, no matter there distance or their mass.
The Qt interface allow user to see and play with the simulation during the computations.


## Usage
First, you will have to generate the builder Makefile:

    make

Then, go to build dir, build the project and launch it:

    cd build
    make
    ./gravastre


## Interactions
Currently, some interactions are implemented:
- Mouse:
    - left click: create a new unamed astre (hold to define an initial speed)
    - right click: translation of the view (not properly working)
- Keyboard:
    - i/e: decrease or increase mass of next created astres
    - d: clear all universe
    - o/p: decrease or increase the new astre initial speed sensitivity
    - space: recenter to the default view

Before compilation, you may want to take a look to:
- main.cpp, where the initial system is defined
- converters.h, where some constants including collision presence, pixel per UA and simulation speed are defined


## Features
- [X] complete and personalisable simulation
- [ ] zoom and translation in the world
- [ ] astre selection
- [ ] astre realistic radius + token for replace astre when too far
- [ ] print astre name when mouse over it (or its token)
- [ ] config file for constants
- [ ] config file for systems
- [ ] save systems
- [ ] provides GUI for generation of stable systems
- [ ] improve existing GUI with informations about selected astre


## Units
See the _converters.h_ header for units definitions and constants.
Units used by the Astre class are real units ; conversions to non real units is done dynamically,
when needed by the computations.

All position of Astres are given in [Astronomical Unit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomical_unit).
The high-left border of the screen is the position reference, at (0;0).

Speeds are given to the engine in kilometer per seconds (for user convenience),
although the speed is internally in [meter per second](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SI_base_unit).
